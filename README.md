# SignShineWithoutAI
SignShine Apps is my final year project for my Diploma in Software &amp; Apps Development. Itâ€™s an e-learning platform designed to improve communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community, featuring real-time sign language translation, interactive lessons, and a teacher/admin portal.
